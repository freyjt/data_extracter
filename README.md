Messing around with pulling data from a website using phantomjs

<p>This code pulls all of the gamelog data from <a href="http://espn.go.com">espn</a>
for NBA games.<br/> Then stores it all to a JSON file, currently called 'testData.JSON'<br/>
<br/> Play with it a bit, it's moderately extensible to different use cases<br/>
(not at all, that was a lie).

Required software
<ul>
    <li>nodejs<br/>
        -standard install
    </li>
    <li>phamtomjs</li>
</ul>
To run
<ul>
    <li>clone it....</li>
    <li>nodejs main.js (or node ..however you call node)</li>
</ul>

Messing around with pulling data from a website using phantomjs

<p>This code pulls all of the gamelog data from <a href="espn.go.com">espn</a>
for NBA games.<br/> Then stores it all to a JSON file, currently called 'testData.JSON'<br/>
<br/> Play with it a bit, it's moderately extensible to differentuse cases<br/>
(not at all).

Required software
<ul>
<li>nodejs<br/>
 -standard install
</li>
<li>phamtomjs</li>

To run
<ul>
<li>clone it....</li>
<li>nodejs main.js (or node ..however you call node)</li>
    </ul>
